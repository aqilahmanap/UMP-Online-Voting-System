# UMP-Online-Voting-System
This is my Final Year Project called UMP Online Voting System. 
In this system, admin can view and edit the Category List, Voting List, Users, and admin can generate result. Students can acts as a voter to cast votes on the candidates. To proceed with the voting process, student need to perform verification on the MS Teams. Student need to open their camera and show their matric number for verification.

Firstly, import umpovs.sql to phpmyadmin.

To use the system, you can log in into the system as two users which are admin and voter.

Open file login.php to login.

To login as an admin, enter username CB18116 and password admin123.

To login as a voter, enter username CB18116 and password voter123.
